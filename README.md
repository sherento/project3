# Augmented Reality (AR):

This is the final project for the General Assembly Web Development immersive course.
I decided to play around and do an augmented reality project.
This project is based on a marker AR using three basic 'A', 'B' and 'C' markers for animated three dimensional shapes and our class 'WDI24' marker for our class sticker and class photo.

### Built with:

The project uses HTML5 and JavaScript with the threejs and arjs libraries.

### Try my project:

To view my project, please go to: https://sherento.github.io/project3/
This url could be used on webcam or android to view AR images over markers.
The markers are also available in the images folder.

### Bugs and future fixes

The class photo used on the mobile is a little compressed compared when view on the webcam.
Would like to incorporate a three dimensional affect using blender
